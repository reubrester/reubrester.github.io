    <h1>Reuben Rester's Coding Journey</h1>
    <h2>My personal site and coding portfolio</h2>
    <p>
      This is my personal site which details my journey through theodinproject.org and will serve as my coding portfolio.
      This is a basic site for now but will evolve as I learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will add links to this site periodically.
